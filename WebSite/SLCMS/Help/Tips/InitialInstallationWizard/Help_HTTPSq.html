	If this is a regular website then normal connections are the correct setting even if there is an eCommerce or other secure SSL component of SLCMS being used.
	The normal setting allows both types of connections.

<p>
	If this website is to be used in a secure way with SSL only and never use normal http conections then select &quot;SSL only&quot;. 
	Any connection made via a normal connection will be redirected to the secure one (An SSL certificate has to be installed for this to work).
