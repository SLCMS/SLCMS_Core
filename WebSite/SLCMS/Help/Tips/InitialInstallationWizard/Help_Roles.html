	This choice helps define what you are going to use this SLCMS site for. 
	The wizard is still going to ask questions 
	but has a lot of predefined configurations and making a choice here will save a lot of typing later.

	If you set SLCMS to behave as the standard &quot;Production Site&quot; 
	role then it would be running at its most efficient with settings such that any errors that might occur are graceful,
	no debugging information is displayed, notification emails are sent to the designated person, etc.
	At the other extreme the &quot;Design&quot; mode is the one SLCMS code developers use
	and then there are debugging messages and other useful aids to development that you don't want in the Production environment.
