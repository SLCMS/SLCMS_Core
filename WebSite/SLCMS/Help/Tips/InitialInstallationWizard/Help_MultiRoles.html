	If this installation of SLCMS is one of many on this machine/server then here is where you manage that fact. 
</p>
<p>
	If this installation is a single installation on a shared or standalone server or your workstation or wherever then just say &quot;No&quot;.	
</p>
<p>
	If you are going to have several SLCMS sites sitting alongside each other performing the same role such as several Production sites then say &quot;No&quot;.	
</p>
<p>
	If you are going to have several SLCMS sites sitting alongside each other performing different roles
	(for example if you are in a development environment with one site being used for code development and another for designing templates)
	then say &quot;Yes&quot; and the Wizard will adjust the configuration to compensate.
</p>
<p>
	In case you are wondering why we have to know this it is because of the way that SLCMS starts up and works out what it is doing.
	On startup it asks the machine/workstation/server what name it has and then looks that name up in its configuration files to choose the correct one and then it can run the website correctly.
	If it did not do this but just started up with a standard configuration then you would not be able to run many copies of SLCMS side by side performing different roles, 
	they would all have to be the same.
