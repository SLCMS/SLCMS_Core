	The Domain Name of the website is needed internally by SLCMS if there are parts of the site that are sending information to the Internet and need a response,
	such as eCommerce gateways.
</p>
<p>
	If this SLCMS site is going to be used as a portal, ie it will have subSites, then the domain name should be the bare domain name, 
	with no &quot;www&quot; at the beginning (EG &quot;slcms.net&quot; not &quot;www.slcms.net&quot;). 
	For a portal-enabled SLCMS site this short version of the domain name has to be used to allow for management of all subdomains of the site.
